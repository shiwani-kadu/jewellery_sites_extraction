### Purpose
The script reads a JSON file containing URLs categorized by regions, constructs API-compatible URLs, sends HTTP requests to fetch data, parses the responses to extract product IDs, and saves the final list of product IDs to an output JSON file.

---

### Key Components

#### 1. **Imports**
```python
import argparse
import json
import logging
import random
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import requests
```
- **argparse**: Parses command-line arguments.
- **json**: Reads and writes JSON files.
- **logging**: Handles logging information and errors.
- **random** & **time**: Used for backoff and delays.
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Manages concurrent execution of tasks (multithreading).
- **requests**: Makes HTTP requests.

---

#### 2. **Logging Configuration**
```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()],
)
```
- This sets up logging with a specific format and displays log messages in the console.

---

#### 3. **Constants**
```python
HEADERS = {
    'accept': 'application/json, text/plain, */*',
    # Other HTTP headers
    'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 ...',
}
```
An HTTP header (`HEADERS`) defines the request headers used when making API calls. It simulates a web browser for the request to prevent blocking by the target server.

#### 4. **Functions**

##### **parse_data(response, data_list)**
- Extracts `product_code` from a JSON response and appends it to the provided list.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Parses the JSON response using `response.json()`.
  - Looks for `data['product_list']` and iterates through each product.
  - Appends the `product_code` to `data_list`.
  - Logs any errors during parsing.

##### **convert_url(url)**
- Converts a given URL into an API-compatible URL by making modifications via string replacements.
- Example:
  - Input: `"https://www.qeelin.com/categories"`
  - Output: `"https://cms.qeelin.com/api/category"`

##### **fetch_page(url, headers)**
- Attempts to fetch a page using an HTTP GET request. Includes retries with exponential backoff in case of failure.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Makes up to 5 attempts to fetch the page.
  - If a failure occurs, it sleeps for progressively longer delays (1, 2, 4 seconds, etc.).
  - Returns the `response` object if successful; otherwise logs an error and returns `None`.

##### **process_url(base_url, headers, region)**
- Combines the base URL with a region-specific query parameter to construct the API URL. Uses `fetch_page` to retrieve the data, parses it with `parse_data`, and collects the resulting product IDs.
- Example:
  - Base URL: `"https://www.qeelin.com/categories"`
  - Region: `"AU"`
  - Final API URL: `"https://cms.qeelin.com/api/category?sort=*&region=AU"`

##### **main()**
- The main function ties everything together:
  1. Parses the region argument from the command line.
  2. Reads input URLs grouped by regions from a JSON file (`qeelin_categories.json`).
  3. Uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to process URLs concurrently, improving efficiency for multiple requests.
  4. Collects all product IDs from multiple threads and saves them in a region-specific JSON output file.

### Workflow of the Script

1. **Input Handling**
   - The script starts by taking a `--region` argument (e.g., `AU`, `US`).
   - It reads a JSON file (`qeelin_categories.json`) located in a relative directory. The structure of this file is expected to have region-specific URLs.

2. **URL Processing**
   - Each URL from the input is processed using the `process_url` function.
   - `convert_url` modifies the URL to an API endpoint.
   - `fetch_page` performs the HTTP request to fetch data.

3. **Data Parsing**
   - `parse_data` extracts `product_code` values from the API response JSON.
   - Any errors during parsing (e.g., unexpected data) are logged.

4. **Multithreading**
   - URLs are processed concurrently using `ThreadPoolExecutor`, allowing multiple requests to be made simultaneously (with up to 5 threads).

5. **Output Handling**
   - The final list of `product_code` values is saved into a region-specific JSON file in the `listing directory`.

---
```

- The program reads `qeelin_categories.json` for URLs under `"AU"`.
- Constructs API-compatible URLs, fetches, and parses product codes.
- Saves the extracted product codes to a file named `qeelin_links_AU.json`.

---

### Error Handling
- **File Errors**: Logs issues while reading input or writing output files.
- **HTTP Errors**: Retries requests up to 5 times with exponential backoff.
- **Parsing Errors**: Logs unexpected issues during JSON parsing.

---

### Key Design Considerations
1. **Threading**: Efficiently processes multiple URLs concurrently.
2. **Retries**: Ensures robust operations despite intermittent network errors.
3. **Logging**: Tracks errors and provides detailed insight into processing flow.
4. **Modularity**: Each function has a specific role, making the code easier to maintain and extend.
